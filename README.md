# Tech-News-JSON-Data

Developed the Hacker News Top 10 app, a Java-based Android application that utilized the Hacker News API to load the top 10 news stories from the site

The steps I took to implement the app:
- Utilized asynchronous programming to ensure that the app remained responsive while retrieving data from the Hacker News API
- Worked with JSON data to parse the responses received from the API and extract the relevant information
- Implemented the ability to download data from the Hacker News website to provide real-time updates to the app using HttpURLConnection
- Implemented an SQLite database to store data locally on the device, providing a seamless experience for the user and improving the app's performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be retrieved from the Hacker News API

What I learned during development:
- Asynchronous programming to keep the app responsive while fetching data from the Hacker News API
- Working with JSON data to parse API responses and handle errors in case of invalid or incomplete responses
- Downloading data from a website using HttpURLConnection to provide real-time updates to the app
- Implementing an SQLite database to store data locally on the device, providing a seamless experience for users even if offline or experiencing connectivity issues
- These skills are essential for a Java Android developer job and have equipped me with the ability to deliver high-quality applications that meet the needs of both users and stakeholders.
